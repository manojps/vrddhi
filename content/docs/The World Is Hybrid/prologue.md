# What inspired this work?

Four things.

1. Tesla CEO's rant that hybrid cars don't make sense. Yes, this work was inspired by a talk about hybrid cars, although it is not about hybrid cars. See the irony!

2. My experience with data structures in computer systems during my Ph.D. journey.

3. Discussions on the philosophy and spread of monotheistic religions by different people and recalling my own experiences in this regard. If you can recall Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens (Chapter 12. The Law of Religion), you can proably guess what I am talking about.

4. Reflecting on my understanding of human nature and our tendency to seek simple answers, regardless of the complexity of a problem.
